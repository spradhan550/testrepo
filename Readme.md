## How DevOps Improves Software Delivery

1. **Faster Delivery:**  
   Automation and CI/CD pipelines assist teams to release software with faster and reliability.
   
3. **Improved Collaboration:**  
   Devops eliminates the communication and responsibility divide between development and operations teams.
   
5. **Higher Quality:**  
   Continuous integration and automated testing will identify bugs at an early stage and minimize production problems.

6. **Scalability:**  
   IaC allows quick development, control, and expansion of environments.
   
8. **Continuous Feedback:**  
   The background of real-time monitoring and logging provides teams with data-driven information to enhance software on a continuous basis.
